<h1 align="center">Library Aplication</h1>

<p>This program is being developed without libraries or Spring Boot, only pure Java to train OOP resources.</p>

<p>To develop the logic of this simple Application, it was necessary to separate responsibilities in the methods.</p>

<p>The User class was developed first to be easier to understand the application through the user's perspective.</p>

<p>Then, the User class was finished in the Library class, which is being called at the Main class.</p>

<p>The Author class was developed to be called at the Library class, to be easier to find the books.</p>
